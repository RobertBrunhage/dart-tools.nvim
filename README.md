# Installation

using `vim-plug`

```vim
Plug 'robertbrunhage/dart-tools.nvim'
```

using `packer.nvim`

```lua
use {'robertbrunhage/dart-tools.nvim'}
```

using `lazy.nvim`

```lua

## Goal
Run Flutter or Dart through terminal should be a good experience.

## What it won't be
A replacement for tools such as [flutter-tools.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/flutter-tools.nvim).

I just personally likes to use the terminal commands with Tmux

Currently includes
- [x] Hot reload when running through terminal
- [ ] ???
